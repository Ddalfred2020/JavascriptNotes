# Variables

variables are containers for storing values in javascript, that container is given a name and value is assigned to the that container
to create a variable in javascript we use the ` let key word` the let key word create a variable a variable  `let name = 'stanley';` this create the variable name and assign the string stanley to it, once a variable has been created in memory there is no need using the the let keyword to refer to the variable instead you can refer to the variable using the variable name

variable can also be created using the const keyword infact this is the recommended way of creating variablebut you can use the let keyword to create variable whose value will change during the cause of the program
```
cons sum = 120;
```

The values of a variable can be reasign, the let variable can be reasign but the variable created with the const key cannot be reassign
