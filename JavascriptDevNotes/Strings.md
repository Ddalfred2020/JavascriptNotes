# Strings

Strings are just a piece of text in javascript and it signify by a text within a single quote or double quote
```
'hello'
"hello world"
```
it is always better to use the single quote because it is easier to write and cause less confusion though are situation where we can use the double quote, when for example the text contain single quote character
```
"i'm going to england next week" in such case you can use the double quote
```
you can also use the escape character to escape the the single quote
```
'i\'m going tommorrow'
```
escape character for exscaping single and double quotes are 
```
\" for double quotes
\' for single quotes
```
in addition to the normal string we also have the templates strings created by bartick character
example of template string

```
`i am going to london next week`
```

we can insert a value, any value into the template by using the `${}` the process is called interpolation
template string is useful when we want insert a value in a string otherwise use the normal string
```
`i am going to ${} london next week`
```
when you add a string to a number, the number automatically turn to a string
```
'wellcome' + 5
'wellcome5'
```
when you add two strings together it form a single string and the process is known as concatenation
```
'hello' + 'world'
'helloworld'
```
a character is any letter, number or symbol
```
letter a,b,c...
number 1,3,4....
symbol $,#,@...
