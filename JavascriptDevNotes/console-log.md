In javascript some of the codes you write , you write them in the console tab, you access the console tab by right clicking the browser page and go to inspect and click the console tab but when you are writting your code in the script tag you will want to display the result of your code in the console, that is when you use `console.log('hello');` this simply tells the computer to display the output of this code in the console.

there are several ways of running javascripts code 
* by writting the code in the console tab
* by writting the code in `the onclick=""` attribute
* by writting the code within a script tag
  ```
  <script>

  </script>
  ```
  the code
  ```
  document.body.innerHTML='hello';
  tells the computer to clear everything in the page and replace it by hello
  ```
